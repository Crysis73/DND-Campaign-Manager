# Final-Project-Team-Bravo

Authors: Casey Haskins <cahaskins@bsu.edu>, Rebecca Auger <raauger@bsu.edu>

This is our final project for our CS222 class at Ball State University. Our project guidelines were simply to create something from the ground up and make it do a little more with each successive iteration. For our project, we decided to make a DND Campaign Manger (which we might generify in the future that way we can license and distribute this software).

We allow users to: 
• Create new campaigns 
• Save their campaigns 
• Load existing campaigns 
• Create characters and add them to campaigns 
• Auto generate character stats necessary for gameplay 
• Perform trait checks 
• Perform dice rolls outside of trait checks. 
• Manage character level/XP 
• If a character levels up, their HP bonus from leveling is automatically generated and applied. 
• Manage character Wealth 
• Transfer wealth from one character to another using a "PayTo" menu. 
• Manage current HP and Max HP 
• Read/View/Save a log of all the actions that have taken place in their campaign 
• Manually add entries to log • Switch from a light theme to a dark theme 
• Generate and save a Combat Order for the characters in a campaign 
• Resize the multiple panes within a view 
• Manually edit character information after creation 
• And probably a few more things I'm forgetting after having worked on this project for a while that all take place within a responsive and well designed user interface
